## Face Detection:
Multi-task cascascaded convolutional neual network (mtcnn) is used.
This detects side faces, multiple faces and even eyes covered in glasses unlike the previosuly popular and simplistic Viola Jones model which is based on haar features and can only detect single frontal facial features.
